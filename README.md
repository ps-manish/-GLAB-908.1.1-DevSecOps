## The DevSecOps Car Ride

Imagine that you are taking a car ride with a developer, a security officer, and an infrastructure guy. As you drive along, you discuss the challenges of implementing DevSecOps in your organization. Here's a transcript of your conversation:

You: So, how do we make sure that security is integrated into the development process from the very beginning?

Developer: Well, we need to start by identifying potential security risks and vulnerabilities in our code. We can use tools like static analysis and penetration testing to help us find these issues early on.

Security Officer: And we need to make sure that security is a top priority throughout the entire software development lifecycle. We can do this by setting up policies and procedures that prioritize security and compliance.

Infrastructure Guy: Plus, we need to make sure that our infrastructure is designed with security in mind. We can use tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems to protect our networks and data.

You: That all makes sense, but how do we make sure that everyone is on the same page?

Developer: We need to establish a culture of collaboration and communication between the development, security, and infrastructure teams. This will help us work together more effectively and ensure that security is integrated into everything we do.

Security Officer: And we need to make sure that everyone understands the importance of security and compliance. This means providing training and education to all employees, not just the security team.

Infrastructure Guy: And we need to make sure that our infrastructure is designed to be easily managed and updated. This will make it easier to keep everything secure and up-to-date.

You: Okay, that all sounds good. So, what can we do to get started?

Developer: We can start by implementing some basic security measures in our development process. For example, we can use code reviews and testing to catch security issues early on.

Security Officer: And we can set up policies and procedures to ensure that security is always a top priority. We can also conduct regular security audits to make sure that everything is working properly.

Infrastructure Guy: And we can make sure that our infrastructure is designed with security in mind. This means using secure protocols and encryption, as well as monitoring our systems for any unusual activity.

You: Great, let's divide into three teams now and work on some activities related to DevSecOps.


## The DevSecOps Browser Setup

In this classroom activity, you will play the roles of the Developer, Security Officer, and Infrastructure Guy from the DevSecOps car ride. You will work together to set up a web browser that meets security requirements while also being functional for development purposes.

### Instructions

- [ ] The Infrastructure Guy will provide a computer for the Developer to use. They will need to estimate the resources required to run a web browser, such as CPU and RAM, and ensure that the computer meets these requirements.

- [ ] The Developer will download and install a web browser of their choice that meets their development needs. They will need to check that the browser is up-to-date and configured correctly.

- [ ] The Security Officer will review the browser configuration and block any websites that pose a security risk. They will also implement any other security measures that are necessary.

- [ ] The Developer will test the browser to ensure that it meets their needs and that all necessary websites are accessible.

- [ ] The Infrastructure Guy and Security Officer will continue to monitor the computer and the browser to ensure that they remain secure and functional.

### Questions

- Why is it important to consider security when setting up a web browser for development purposes?
- What are some potential security risks associated with using a web browser for development?
- What are some best practices for configuring a web browser for development purposes while also ensuring security?
